Feature: Create a Calendar events
  As a Staff Member at PTO,
  I want to create an event with name, location, description and time,
  So that I can let everyone who goes to the website know that there is an event coming up

  Background: the website already has some existing calendar event
    Given these CalendarEvents:
      | title        | description               | start_date_time            | end_date_time              | location                | is_sport | is_musical | contact_person        | is_approved |
      | football     | cozy and sunny            | 3rd Feb 2021 04:05:06 PM   | 2nd Mar 2021 04:05:06 PM   | Lathrop, Hamilton, NY   | true     |            | hnguyenvu@colgate.edu | true        |
      | jazz concert | come and chill with music | 6th Feb 2020 04:05:06 PM   | 8th Feb 2021 04:05:06 PM   | Ho, Hamilton, NY        |          | true       | pdhawka@colgate.edu   | true        |

  Scenario: Create a new calendar event with a status of approved without adding pictures
    Given I am on the create calendar event page
    When I fill in the following:
      | Title                    | easter egg decoration            |
      | Description              | have fun eating hardboiled eggs  |
      | Start date of the event  | 3rd Jan 2021 04:05:06 AM         |
      | End date of the event    | 3rd Jan 2021 04:05:06 PM         |
      | Location                 |  Newell, Colgate University |
      | For family               |  true |
      | Contact person email     |  hnguyenvu@colgate.edu |


    When I press "Create event"
    Then I should be on the calendar events page
    And I should see "New event 'easter egg decoration' created and added to the page"
    And I should see that "easter egg decoration" has a datetime of "2021/01/03 04:05"
    And I should see "football"
    And I should see "jazz concert"
    When I follow "jazz concert"
    Then I should see "jazz concert"
    And I should see "come and chill with music"
    And I should see the image "default_image_event"
